										<p> I pray that the Lord gives us strength to use every available mechanism to grow a Christ-like youth by meeting their respective needs and interests. We will adopt four key thematic areas in making sure that every youth is considered and made a priority in the Church. </p>

										<p><strong>1.	SOCIAL INTEREST</strong><br>
											According to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, in his book, Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement with Everyday Life, “Socializing is more positive than being alone, that’s why meetings are so popular. People don’t like being alone. That would be, however, an important skill to learn...”. According to the best seller, every human being needs to be in a social group in order to be complete as humans.
											Research has shown that most church members, especially the youth have branded our Church to be a boring one because they haven’t been availed to the prospects of socializing with other youth from other locations of the Church. 
											This is why the Master Guide Club of Ashanti Central Ghana Conference under this administration would organize more social events for our members. This would provide them with the opportunity to experience and learn from people of other cultures, acquire knowledge from their ways and develop new ideas in serving God.
											Among these social events would include; Musical Concerts, Fun Games, Excursions,  award services and others. Every Member of the Master Guide Club would be given the opportunity to socialize among ourselves and those around us.
											Again, most of our members are still unemployed and we would use the club to create avenues for them to gain useful experience and employment.
										</p>
										<p>
											2.	<strong>PHYSICAL NEEDS</strong><br>
											“The glory of young men is their strength.” Proverbs 20:29. 
											In the words of Ellen G. White in Healthy Living Page 131, “God designed that the living machinery should be in daily activity. For in this activity or motion is its preserving power.... The more we exercise, the better will be the circulation of the blood.” 
											This is why the Master Guide Club of Ashanti Central Ghana Conference under the current leadership would adopt to a lot of Healthy Living Activities like Hiking, Health Screenings, Marching Drills and many more to ensure that the Youth are healthy. 
											According to Mrs. White in Reflecting Christ - Page 147, “Attention to health is one of our most important duties. We owe this to ourselves, to society, and to God. Young men and young women are proverbially careless in regard to their health....”. This is why we intend put more emphasis on healthy living to equip our members to serve our Maker in good health.

										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>3.	MENTAL SUPPORT</strong>
											As Children of God and His disciples, our utmost assignment is to spread His message to all the world before His second coming. Sincerely, this cannot be done in a vacuum. We can only achieve that through effective Bible Studies and understanding of our Church’s policies. 
											The Master Guide Club of Ashanti Central Ghana Conference under our leadership would adopt to effective ways to entice the youth to take Bible Studies serious. We would do our honest part in making the youth memorize as many Biblical texts, as well as Spirit of Prophecy quotes as possible.
											These would be done through competitive programmes like Quiz Competitions, Doctrinal Debates, Bible Dialogues, Bible lectures and many more.

										</p>
										<p>
											<strong>4.	SPIRITUAL WELFARE </strong>
											The Laws of the Pathfinder Club of the Seventh-day Adventist Church instructs all Seventh-day Adventist youth to keep the morning watch by studying the word of God religiously in order to make disciples for Christ. It enjoins the youth to do their honest part in achieving this height by caring for their bodies, keeping a level eye in every decision they make, whiles being courteous and obedient to all human beings they encounter irrespective of their status and gender. 
											The Pathfinder law also enjoins the youth to walk softly in God’s sanctuary by giving reverence to God and His Sacred Church. The youth are equally expected to keep the right songs in their hearts to avoid being corrupted by the devil. 
											All these laws sums up to prepare the Adventists Pathfinder to go on God’s errands. Which is to proclaim the word of God to this dying world as commissioned in Revelation 14:6. 
											The ASCG Master Guide Club under the current leadership would make evangelism one of our pillars and also declare war on backsliding especially among the Youth. We would use the above outlined areas to meet every member at their respective points of need or interest. With the help of God, we would do all we can identify the interest of every member and meet them accordingly.
											<ul style="font-weight: bold; color: blue">
												<li>Long live, the Master Guide Club.</li>
												<li>Long live, Adventist Youth Ministry</li>
												<li>Long live Ashanti Central Ghana Conference</li>
											</ul>
